@article{efficient-feature-extraction,
  abstract  = {Due to the presence of non-stationarities and discontinuities in the audio signal, segmentation and classification of audio signal is a really challenging task. Automatic music classification and anno-tation is still considered as a challenging task due to the difficulty of extracting and selecting the optimal audio features. Hence, this paper proposes an efficient approach for segmentation, feature extraction and classification of audio signals. Enhanced Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (EMFCC)-Enhanced Power Normalized Cepstral Coefficients (EPNCC) based feature extraction is applied for the extraction of features from the audio signal. Then, multi-level classification is done to classify the audio signal as a musical or non-musical signal. The proposed approach achieves better per-formance in terms of precision, Normalized Mutual Information (NMI), F-score and entropy. The PNN classifier shows high False Rejection Rate (FRR), False Acceptance Rate (FAR), Genuine Ac-ceptance rate (GAR), sensitivity, specificity and accuracy with respect to the number of classes.},
